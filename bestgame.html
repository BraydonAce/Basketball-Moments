    <h1>My Best Game That I've Had</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>The best game that I've had in my basketball career was actually pretty recently, during the high school basketball season. This game wasn't the most points I've ever scored in a game, but I was on fire. I hit 9 threes, which is a freshman record, and it could be a record in Junior Varsity or Varsity too, but I don't know how to check the records, but the varsity coach told me it was a freshman record. I ended up with 31 points in the game. I have had more than that before, but this was my best game because I was being double teamed the whole time, because the team we played knows who I am, and made a game plan to try to stop me, according to their players after the game. But, they could not stop me. We did end up losing, but not by much. We haven't won a game yet this year, but we still have some games left. Also, it was even better to do that to that team, because I am friends with everyone on that team, and their coach was my coach on another team, so that made it even better.</p>
