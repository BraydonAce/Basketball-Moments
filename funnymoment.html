    <h1>My Favorite Moment</h1>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>This favorite moment is just my favorite moment in general, out of any basketball game that I've been in. This was with one of my favorite teams that I've played on, called Marathon. There was a lot of stuff leading up to this, but I will try to shorten it a little bit. So basically, Marathon had its own gym that we could use, so we practiced a lot. But, the people that owned the gym along with my coach were not very good people, and started mistreating people, including my coach, so he was going to quit. But, there was one more tournament that we had to do. We hadn't won any tournaments yet, so we were trying to win this one. There had been a lot of people on the team, and a lot of people had left the team, and a lot of people joined the team over these different tournaments. But, throughout that time, the 4 original people that were on the team from the beginning were there. Eventually, we got to the championship game in the tournament, against the team that we lost to earlier in the tournament, which was the only team we lost to. With about a minute left, I came down the court, and I hit a pretty deep three, to cut the other team's lead to four. Then, the other teams coach was yelling at our coach because he was mad, and he got a technical foul called on him, and I got an extra free throw, which I made, cutting their lead to three. Then, we got a stop on defense, and got the ball back. Then, my teammate Cory, got the ball, came off of a screen, and hit a three as well, tying the game, with like 30 seconds left. We full court pressed, but they still got the ball down the court. The person that I was guarding drove to the hoop, and I got a nice block on him, but they called it a foul. For the record, the refs had been calling bad calls the whole game. The guy goes up to the free throw line, and makes the first shot, but then misses the second, meaning they were only up by 1. We got the rebound and called a timeout. Our coach drew up a play for my teammate Shamond, and had me draw the defense towards me, and away from him, since I was hitting a lot of shots that game. We came out, passed it in to him, and my teammate Gary set me a screen, and I went to the other side of the court, and had 2 people follow me. In that time, Shamond got by his guy with a nice move, and since I ran to the other side, he was wide open, and took it to the hoop and made it with 0.4 seconds left. They tried to throw it in to my guy, but I had him covered, and Shamond came over and stole the ball to win the game. We all were celebrating like crazy. After that, though, I realized that the three people who made shots to win the game were the original three on the team, and after all those people had done who owned the gym, it was cool to win that tournament.  </p>
